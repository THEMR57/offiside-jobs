When I used to play local matches in cricket grounds or turf, there was a major problem of finding a fair umpire, as they are a important part of any game as if they favor any team the overall enjoyment of the game goes down, so i created a website where people could post where and which sport they are playing and people who like umpiring can apply for these jobs.
This benefits both parties.
